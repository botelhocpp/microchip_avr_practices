# Microchip AVR Practices with ATmega328P

## Full Bare-metal Codes for Microchip's AVR ATmega328P microcontroller using Arduino Uno board.

This repository has the intent of bringing each functionality of the MCU without any underlying layer. 

Basically I build a static library called "avrbsp". It has a simple linker script, a Makefile, as well as functions and definitions for each peripheral of the MCU. My objective is to enable easy development with this MCU.
